Header: What is Deep Learning?
Content: 
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. It is particularly useful for handling large and complex data sets, enabling machines to improve at tasks that involve recognizing patterns, making predictions, and decision-making. Deep Learning models learn from vast amounts of data through a process that involves feeding them input data and adjusting the internal parameters based on the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes.

Content: 
Deep Learning relies on several key concepts including neural networks, layers, neurons, weights, activation functions, and loss functions. Common architectures include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data like text or time series.
- Autoencoders for data compression and denoising.
These architectures help in modeling complex patterns in data by building models layer-by-layer in a hierarchical manner.
